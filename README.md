# Timeline from successor representation

A simple example of creating a compressed timeline from a set of successor representations (with a spectrum of time constants) using inverse Laplace transform. Successor representations and the timeline contain the same amount of information about the future stimuli. However, the information in the timeline is represented such that the estimate of what stimuli will be presented and when is readily accessible.
